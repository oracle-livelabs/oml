# Select and manipulate data using the transparency layer

## Introduction

This lab shows how to use the transparency layer classes to work with data and to perform exploratory analysis of the data.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk through of the lab.

### About data selection and manipulation
The transparency layer classes allow you to convert select Python objects to Oracle Autonomous Database objects. It allows users to call a range of familiar Python functions that are overloaded to invoke the corresponding SQL on tables in the
database.
The Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) transparency layer supports functions that interact with database data and enables you to:
* Load Python `pandas.DataFrame` objects to Oracle Database to create database tables
* Access and manipulate database tables and views through the use of proxy objects
* Overload Python functions, translating their functionality into SQL
* Leverage proxy objects for database data
* Use familiar Python syntax to manipulate database data

### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:
  * Use the `oml.push` function to create a temporary table
  * Work with table rows and columns using proxy objects
  * Work with `pandas.DataFrame` objects
  * Use the `append`, `concat` and `merge` functions to manipulate data
  * Use the `split` and `KFold` functions to partition the data
  * Use the `crosstab` and `pivot_table` functions on an OML DataFrame proxy
  * Use the `oml.boxplot` and `oml.hist` functions to create plots 
  * Manage and explore data using OML4Py Transparency Layer functions
  * Use `cx_Oracle` functions to submit SQL queries from Python

### Prerequisites

We need to access and run the OML notebook for this lab.

1. Go back to the main notebooks listing by clicking on the "hamburger" menu (the three lines) on the upper left of the screen, and then select **Notebooks**.

 ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks menu](images/go-back-to-notebooks.png " ")

2. Click the **Lab 2 notebook name** to view it.
   <if type="freetier">
   ![Open Lab 2 notebook ft](images/click-on-lab2-ft.png " ") </if>
   <if type="livelabs">
   ![Open Lab 2 notebook ll](images/click-on-lab2-ll.png " ") </if>

  OML Notebooks will create a session and make the notebook available for editing.

  You can optionally click the **Run all paragraphs** (![](images/run-all-paragraphs.png =20x*)) icon, and then click **OK** to confirm to refresh the content with your data, or just scroll down and read the pre-recorded results.
