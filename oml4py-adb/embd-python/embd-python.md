# Run user-defined functions using Embedded Python Execution

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to use OML4Py Embedded Python Execution functions to run custom Python code.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk through of the lab.

### About Embedded Python Execution
Embedded Python Execution enables you to run user-defined Python functions in Python engines spawned in the Oracle Autonomous Database environment. These engines run alongside an OML Notebooks Python interpreter session.

The OML4Py Embedded Python Execution functions are:

* `oml.do_eval`&mdash;Calls a Python function in Python engines spawned by the Oracle Autonomous Database environment.
* `oml.group_apply`&mdash;Partitions a database table by the values in one or more columns and runs the provided user-defined Python function on each partition.
* `oml.index_apply`&mdash;Calls a Python function multiple times, passing in a unique index of the invocation to the user-defined function.
* `oml.row_apply`&mdash;Partitions a database table into sets of rows and runs the provided user-defined Python function on the data in each set.
* `oml.table_apply`&mdash;Calls a Python function on data in the database as a single pandas.DataFrame in a single Python engine.

> **Note:** Embedded Python Execution functions are also available through the [Oracle Machine Learning for Python REST API for Embedded Python Execution](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml4py/1/mlepe/rest-endpoints.html).

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Build an open source scikit-learn linear model and scoring script
* Prepare the same script for use with Embedded Python Execution
* Build one model per group using the `group_apply` function
* Return multiple images as a result from Embedded Python Execution

### Prerequisites

We need to access and run the OML notebook for this lab.

1. Go back to the main notebooks listing by clicking on the "hamburger" menu (the three lines) on the upper left of the screen, and then select **Notebooks**.

 ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks menu](images/go-back-to-notebooks.png "Test ")

2. Click the **Lab 5 notebook name** to view it.
   <if type="freetier">
   ![Open Lab 5 notebook ft](images/click-on-lab5-ft.png " ") </if>
   <if type="livelabs">
   ![Open Lab 5 notebook ll](images/click-on-lab5-ll.png " ") </if>

  OML Notebooks will create a session and make the notebook available for editing.

  You can optionally click the **Run all paragraphs** (![](images/run-all-paragraphs.png =20x*)) icon, and then click **OK** to confirm to refresh the content with your data, or just scroll down and read the pre-recorded results.
