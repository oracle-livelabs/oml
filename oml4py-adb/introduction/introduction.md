# Introduction

### About this workshop
This workshop introduces you to Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) on Oracle Autonomous Database. 
Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) supports scalable in-database data exploration and preparation using native Python syntax, scalable in-database algorithms for machine learning model building and scoring, and automated machine learning (AutoML). Users can also invoke user-defined Python functions from Python and REST APIs using database-spawned Python engines. OML4Py increases data scientist productivity and reduces solution deployment complexity.  Join us for this tour of OML4Py.

Python is a major programming language used for data science and machine learning. OML4Py is a new feature on Oracle Autonomous Database that provides Python users access to powerful in-database functionality supporting data scientists for both scalability, performance, and ease of solution deployment.

### About Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py)
Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) is a component of Oracle Autonomous Database, which includes Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Oracle Autonomous JSON Database (AJD). By using Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks on Oracle Autonomous Database, you can run Python functions on database data for exploration, preparation, and modeling while leveraging Oracle Database as a high-performance computing environment. 

Watch the video below for an introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for Python.

### Objectives

 The labs in this workshop focus on the following:

 * Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks and connection to an Oracle Autonomous Database from a Python session
 * Data selection and manipulation using the Transparency Layer
 * In-database algorithms for model building and scoring
 * Datastores to store Python objects
 * Python script repository to store user-defined functions in the database
 * Embedded Python Execution to run user-defined functions in database-spawned and controlled Python engines
 * AutoML functionality supporting automated algorithm and feature selection, along with model tuning and selection


### Prerequisites

- An Oracle Cloud Account. Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported
- Some knowledge in statistics and Python programming is helpful
