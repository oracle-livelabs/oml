 OML Notebooks will load a session and make the notebook available for editing.

### About Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks

A notebook is a web-based interface for data analysis, data discovery, data visualization and collaboration.

The Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks toolbar contains buttons to run code in paragraphs, for configuration settings, and display options.

For example, it displays the status and the number of users connected to the notebook. It also contains a menu item for keyboard shortcuts and options to show or hide the markdown editor and paragraph output. Additional settings are shown in the illustration below.
    ![Notebook toolbar](images/notebook_toolbar.png " ")

## Task 3: Getting started with OML Notebooks and interpreters

OML Notebooks contain a default list of interpreter bindings, used to run scripts against the Autonomous Database that it is linked to.  For this lab, we will set the interpreter binding to "xxxx_medium", where xxxx is the database name.

Click the interpreter bindings icon (![](images/interpreter_bindings_icon_small.png "")) in the upper right-corner of the notebook (the gear) to view the list of available interpreter bindings.
  ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks Interpreter Bindings](images/interpreter_bindings.png " ")

The default service is low. Click to bind or unbind an interpreter. Drag-and-drop individual interpreter binding settings up or down to order which binding will be used by default. The first interpreter on the list becomes the default. Those highlighted in blue are active.

As shown in the example, we dragged the **medium** interpreter up so it is the first in the list, and thus becomes the default.

An interpreter is a plug-in that allows you to use a specific data processing language in your Oracle Machine Learning notebook. You can add multiple paragraphs, and each paragraph can be connected to different interpreters such as SQL, PL/SQL or Python.

You create paragraphs with different interpreters based on the code you want to run, and the interpreter is set at the top of each paragraph.
The available interpreters are:

  - `%md`&mdash;To call the Markdown interpreter and generate static html from Markdown plain text
  - `%sql`&mdash;To call the SQL interpreter and run SQL statements
  - `%script`&mdash;To call and run PL/SQL scripts
  - `%python`&mdash;To call the Python interpreter and run Python scripts

## Task 4: Use the Python interpreter

Let's start by running the entire notebook, so that we can see the result of each paragraph.

Click on the **Run all paragraphs** (![](images/run-all-paragraphs.png =20x*)) icon in front of the name of the notebook, and then click **OK** to confirm to refresh the content with your data, as indicated below.

Another option is to just scroll down and read the pre-recorded results contained in the notebooks themselves.

 ![Click run all Lab1](images/click-run-all-lab1.png " ")

Scroll down on the "Lab 1" Notebook to follow along the steps below.

  ![Scroll down notebooks](images/scroll-down-notebook.png " ")

To run Python commands in a notebook, you must make use of the Python interpreter. This occurs as a result of running your first `%python` paragraph. To use OML4Py, you must import the `oml` module, which automatically establishes a connection to your database.
In an Oracle Machine Learning notebook, you can add multiple paragraphs, and each paragraph can be connected to different interpreters such as SQL or Python. This example shows you how to:

* Connect to a Python interpreter to run Python commands in a notebook
* Import the Python modules&mdash;oml, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib
* Check if the `oml` module is connected to the database

**Note:** `z` is a reserved keyword and must not be used as a variable in `%python` paragraphs in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks. You will see `z.show()` used in the examples to display Python object and proxy object content.

1. To use OML4Py module, you must import the oml module. Type the following Python command to import the `oml` module, and click the **run** icon. Alternatively, you can press Shift+Enter keys to run the notebook.   

  ![Python command to import oml module](images/import_oml.png " ")

2. Using the default interpreter bindings, OML Notebooks automatically establishes a database connection for the notebook.  
  To verify the Python interpreter has established a database connection through the `oml` module, run the command:

  ![Database Connection Verification](images/oml_connected.png " ")

  Once your notebook is connected, the command returns `True`.         

3. The Python `help` function

   The Python `help` function is used to display the documentation of packages, modules, functions, classes, and keywords.

   Scroll down in the notebook to see examples of the use of the `help` function.

## Task 5: Load sample data into tables and views, and grant access to all users

Labs 2 to 6 of this workshop use tables and views that need to be created upfront.  To create these tables and views, we will open the Notebook "Lab 1a: Run Me First - OML4Py table creation and grants".

> **NOTE:** If you have problems with downloading and extracting the ZIP file, please [**CLICK HERE** to download the "Lab 1a: Run Me First - OML4Py table creation and grants" noteook JSON file](./../notebooks/lab1a_run_me_first.json?download=1). This notebook contains the scripts for creating tables and views, and granting the required access. Save it to your local machine and import it like illustrated in **Task 2, Step 1**.

1. Go back to the main Notebooks listing by clicking on the "hamburger" menu (the three lines) on the upper left of the screen, and then select **Notebooks**.

 ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks menu](images/go-back-to-notebooks.png " ")

2. Click the **notebook name** to view it.
   ![Open Lab 1a notebook](images/click-on-lab1a-ft.png " ")

 OML Notebooks will load a session and make the notebook available for editing.

3. Click the **Run all paragraphs** (![](images/run-all-paragraphs.png =20x*)) icon, and then click **OK** to confirm.
  ![Notebook click on run all](images/click-run-all.png " ")

4. Wait until all the paragraphs have finished running and you see your current time in the last paragraph after the message `"PL/SQL procedure successfully completed"`.

  ![The last paragraph with the current timestamp in a notebook](images/last-paragraph.png " ")

The prerequisite scripts have run successfully.

You can now *proceed to the next lab*.
